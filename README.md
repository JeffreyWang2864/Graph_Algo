# graph_algo (subway path finding)

Suppose you live in (or travel to) a place called Yeiv City. One day, you decide to go to the shopping mall with your dudes, but your car is malfunctioned. You have to take the subway in order to hang out with your firends.

here is the subway map.

However, you are so dumb that you don't know the shortest path from where you at to your destination.

In this case, my tool might be useful for you.
